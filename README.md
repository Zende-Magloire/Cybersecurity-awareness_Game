Immerse yourself in the world of cybersecurity with our interactive game!

The Cybersecurity Quiz Game is an educational tool designed to teach students about cybersecurity in a fun and engaging way. The game is tailored for users of different age groups, including middle, elementary, and high school students, offering a unique experience for each level.

Elementary School Level
For elementary school students, the game offers simplified content and easier quiz questions to match their level of understanding. The game sets up a memory card game where each card has a front and back face. When a card is clicked, it flips over to reveal its back face, which contains a term and its meaning. If two flipped cards match, they remain flipped. If they don't match, they flip back over. Players can continue flipping cards until all matches are found.

Middle School Level
For middle school students, the game features interactive tabs that provide information on various cybersecurity topics, such as passwords, social engineering, malware, phishing, and online privacy. Students can click on the tab to learn more about each topic. The game also includes a quiz section where students can test their knowledge by answering questions from different topics.

High School Level
For high school students, the game provides more in-depth content and challenging quiz questions to stimulate critical thinking and deeper learning. The game idea is to design a role-playing game where students play the role of a cybersecurity professional solving real-world cybersecurity challenges. The game includes advanced cybersecurity concepts such as network security, encryption, secure coding practices, and incident response. The content features in-depth explanations, case studies, and practical examples to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Overall, the Cybersecurity Quiz Game aims to educate and engage students in a fun and interactive way, helping them develop essential cybersecurity skills and knowledge.
