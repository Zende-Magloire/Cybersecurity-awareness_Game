This memory game sets up a memory card game where each card has a front and back face. When a card is clicked, 
it flips over to reveal its back face, which contains a term and its meaning. If two flipped cards match, they 
remain flipped. If they don't match, they flip back over. Players can continue flipping cards until all matches 
are found.
